# YourYoutubeTutor

A small personal tool that turns any YouTube video into an interactive English tutor.

## What it does

1. Fetch transcript from a YouTube link
2. Split it into sentences
3. Use an LLM to explain each sentence
4. Allow simple CLI interaction (next / repeat / more / quiz)

## Goal

Provide a lightweight way to learn English from content I actually enjoy.

## Status

MVP in progress.
Tonight’s hack: transcript → sentence split → LLM explanation → simple CLI.
